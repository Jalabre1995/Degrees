# Degrees
According to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in.

In this problem, I am interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”

To solve this I created an AI using Bredth First Search(BFS) to have the AI go through the stars, people, and movies cvs files to see if those two actors starred in a film together. This projects main purpose is to get a better understanding of DFS(Depth-first-search) and BFS(Bredth-first-search).
